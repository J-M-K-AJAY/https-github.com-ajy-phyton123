Python if else, for loop, and range() Exercises
This Python loop exercise include the following: –
It contains 18 programs to solve using if-else statements and looping techniques.
This exercise is nothing but an assignment to solve, where you can solve and practice different loop programs and challenges.
Exercise 1: Print First 10 natural numbers using while loop
 
Expected output:

Exercise 2: Print the following pattern
Write a program to print the following number pattern using a loop.
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5
 
Exercise 3: Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Write a program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
For example, if the user entered 10 the output should be 55 (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10)
Expected Output:

Exercise 4: Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number
For example, num = 2 so the output should be

Exercise 5: Display numbers from a list using loop
Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions
The number must be divisible by five
If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
Given:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
Expected output:


Exercise 6: Count the total number of digits in a number
Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop
For example, the number is 75869, so the output should be 5.


Exercise 7: Print the following pattern
Write a program to use for loop to print the following reverse number pattern
5 4 3 2 1 
4 3 2 1 
3 2 1 
2 1 
1

Exercise 8: Print list in reverse order using a loop
Given:
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Expected output:


Exercise 9: Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop
Expected output:

Exercise 10: Use else block to display a message “Done” after successful execution of for loop
For example, the following loop will execute without any error.
Given:
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
Expected output:

Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers
Examples:
6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2×3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
Given:
# range
start = 25
end = 50
Expected output:

Exercise 12: Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.
For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34.
Expected output:


Exercise 13: Find the factorial of a given number
Write a program to use the loop to find the factorial of a given number.
The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.
For example: calculate the factorial of 5
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
Expected output:


Exercise 14: Reverse a given integer number
Given:
76542
Expected output:

Exercise 15: Use a loop to display elements from a given list present at odd index positions
Given:
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
Note: list index always starts at 0
Expected output:

Exercise 16: Calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Write a program to rint the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Given:
input_number = 6
Expected output:

Exercise 17: Find the sum of the series upto n terms
Write a program to calculate the sum of series up to n term. For example, if n =5 the series will become 2 + 22 + 222 + 2222 + 22222 = 24690
Given:
# number of terms
n = 5
Expected output:

Exercise 18: Print the following pattern
Write a program to print the following start pattern using the for loop
